            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project 1:</strong> Every industry is growing daily as a result of advanced technologies. The banking sector also needs to improve because of the pressures placed on its antiquated systems and the numerous problems they face, including those related to data storage, privacy, scalability, and transparency. These problems made it necessary for the banking system to advance. We understand that the foundation of finance is the banking system. Thus, blockchain technology adoption in banking is necessary because their qualities transparency, data privacy, immutability, decentralization, etc. which could support the banking sector to address the problems with the conventional, centralized banking system. Numerous blockchain-based systems, including transaction, auditing, trading, data sharing, off-chain, and on-chain systems, have already been proposed to the banking sector. However, there isn't a suitable banking solution base system that uses a consortium to carry out the banking process flow and makes sure that all of the previously discussed problems are fixed.
                    We suggested a theoretical model for the banking industry to address these issues. This model makes use of on-chain techniques.
                    as well as off-chain trades using a consortium blockchain which gives each banking user a user ID along with a public and private key. According to this model, information kept off-chain in a third-party database
                    mechanism, and mapped as an on-chain mechanism using user ID and (public\private) Keys, which will be
                    smart contract-based periodic updating and validation. Therefore, if information is altered between two periodic checks, then
                    This tempering is discovered. Security is ensured by this method. In this peer-to-peer consortium model, the P2P protocol
                    is also used to guarantee partial transparency and data privacy. Additionally, this model offers the following three services:
                    registration, a transaction from the bank to the customer, and a transaction to the contractual party. In order to guarantee registered client authentication, the first two services are managed off-chain and the third service is managed on-chain.
                    As we previously stated, no banking system has yet to propose the use of the consortium technique in this regard. Hence, we contrast our model with the transaction models that have already been suggested. Virtually every element needed for a banking system was covered by our suggested model. This model will assist in putting into practice a more reliable, secure, transparent, and scalable blockchain-based banking system.

                </h3>
                Research Paper on (Sentiment Analysis for Depression Detection Using Artificial Intelligence) (Paper ID-1161)
                 Depression, a leading mental health concern, affects millions globally
                Early detection remains crucial for effective intervention.
                Analyzed sentiment analysis capabilities using sophisticated detection systems; identified strengths and limitations, resulting in a 15% enhancement in system reliability and a 10% reduction in false positives.
